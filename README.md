# Supply Chain Analysis - what is in an avocado toast🥑?
 
In this project, I conducted a supply chain analysis of three key ingredients in a popular breakfast dish — avocado toast — using the Open Food Facts database. The goal was to trace the most common countries of origin for avocados, sourdough bread, and olive oil products sold in the UK.

I cleaned and filtered each dataset based on category tags found in accompanying `.txt` files to isolate relevant food products. After narrowing the data down to items sold in the UK, I extracted the most frequent country of origin for each ingredient.

### 🔍 Key Findings
- **Avocados** most commonly originate from **Peru**.
- **Olive oil** is most frequently sourced from **Greece**.
- **Sourdough bread** is most often produced in the **United Kingdom**.

This project highlights how everyday dishes can rely on complex, international supply chains.
