# Supply Chain Analysis - what is in an avocado toastðŸ¥‘?
 
In this project, I conducted a supply chain analysis of three key ingredients in a popular breakfast dish â€” avocado toast â€” using the Open Food Facts database. The goal was to trace the most common countries of origin for avocados, sourdough bread, and olive oil products sold in the UK.

I cleaned and filtered each dataset based on category tags found in accompanying .txt files to isolate relevant food products. After narrowing the data down to items sold in the UK, I extracted the most frequent country of origin for each ingredient.

Key findings:

Avocados most commonly originate from Peru.

Olive oil is most frequently sourced from Greece.

Sourdough bread is most often produced in the United Kingdom.

This project highlights how even simple dishes can rely on complex, international supply chains. It sets the stage for further analysis, such as estimating shipping times or environmental impact.
